### Database Functions (RPC)

For complex operations that can't be easily handled with RLS policies alone, PostgreSQL functions (callable via Supabase RPC) are used. These functions include role-based access checks and return only the data the user is authorized to see.

Example RPC function for fetching dashboard statistics:

```sql
-- Function to get headquarter dashboard stats (for headquarter managers)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_headquarter_dashboard_stats(headquarter_id UUID DEFAULT NULL)
RETURNS JSON
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
DECLARE
    result JSON;
    user_headquarter_id UUID;
BEGIN
    -- If no headquarter_id is provided, get the user's headquarter
    IF headquarter_id IS NULL THEN
        SELECT collaborators.headquarter_id INTO user_headquarter_id
        FROM collaborators
        WHERE collaborators.user_id = auth.uid();

        IF user_headquarter_id IS NULL THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION 'No headquarter found for user';
        END IF;
    ELSE
        user_headquarter_id := headquarter_id;
    END IF;

    -- Check if user has appropriate role and access to this headquarter
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
        WHERE auth.users.id = auth.uid()
        AND (
            auth.users.raw_user_meta_data->>'roles' ? 'superadmin' OR
            auth.users.raw_user_meta_data->>'roles' ? 'general_director' OR
            auth.users.raw_user_meta_data->>'roles' ? 'executive_leader' OR
            (
                auth.users.raw_user_meta_data->>'roles' ? 'headquarter_manager' AND
                EXISTS (
                    SELECT 1 FROM collaborators
                    WHERE collaborators.user_id = auth.uid()
                    AND collaborators.headquarter_id = user_headquarter_id
                )
            )
        )
    ) THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Unauthorized';
    END IF;

    -- Get statistics for the headquarter
    SELECT json_build_object(
        'students_count', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students WHERE students.headquarter_id = user_headquarter_id),
        'facilitators_count', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM collaborators WHERE collaborators.headquarter_id = user_headquarter_id AND role_id = 'facilitator'),
        'companions_count', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM collaborators WHERE collaborators.headquarter_id = user_headquarter_id AND role_id = 'companion'),
        'workshops_count', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workshops WHERE workshops.headquarter_id = user_headquarter_id)
    ) INTO result;

    RETURN result;
END;
$$;
```
## RLS Policies by Table
### Data Integrity & Security

To ensure data integrity and security, the following measures are implemented:

1. **Default Deny**: All tables have RLS enabled with a default deny policy, meaning no access is granted unless explicitly allowed by a policy.
2. **Role-Based Access**: Policies are primarily based on user roles stored in the JWT token.
3. **Scope-Based Restrictions**: Users are restricted to data within their scope (e.g., headquarter managers can only access data for their headquarter).
4. **Operation-Specific Policies**: Different policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
5. **Hierarchical Access**: Higher-level roles inherit access from lower-level roles.

### Headquarters Table

## Database Functions (RPC)

For complex operations that can't be easily handled with RLS policies alone, we use PostgreSQL functions (callable via Supabase RPC):

## Security Considerations

1. **SECURITY DEFINER vs INVOKER**: Most functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` to run with the privileges of the function creator rather than the caller. This is necessary for functions that need to access tables that the caller might not have direct access to. However, it's important to always include explicit permission checks within these functions to prevent privilege escalation.

2. **JWT Claims**: The RLS policies rely on roles stored in the JWT token's `user_metadata`. Ensure that this data is properly validated and that roles can only be assigned by authorized administrators.

3. **Nested Queries**: Many policies use nested EXISTS queries to check both the user's role and their relationship to the data (e.g., whether they manage a specific headquarter). While this approach is secure, it can impact performance on large tables. Consider adding appropriate indexes.

4. **Default Deny**: All tables have RLS enabled with a default deny policy. This ensures that even if a policy is accidentally omitted, access is still restricted.

5. **Explicit Checks**: Policies include explicit checks for each operation type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) rather than using ALL. This provides more granular control and makes the security model easier to audit.

6. **WITH CHECK Clauses**: UPDATE policies use both USING and WITH CHECK clauses to validate both the rows being updated and the new values being set.

7. **Sensitive Field Protection**: Policies for self-updates include checks to prevent users from modifying sensitive fields like status or role assignments.

8. **Error Messages**: Functions include specific error messages (e.g., 'Unauthorized' or 'No headquarter found for user') to aid in debugging without revealing sensitive information.

9. **Search Path**: Functions set a specific search path to prevent search path injection attacks.

10. **Regular Auditing**: Implement regular auditing of RLS policies and functions to ensure they remain effective as the application evolves.
